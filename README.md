## 📌 Project Description
PriorityForge is a vanilla JavaScript application designed to help users prioritize tasks using a weighted scoring algorithm based on Importance, Urgency, and Effort.

## 🛠 Features
- **Smart Prioritization:** Tasks are auto-sorted based on a calculated priority score.
- **Dark Mode:** Fully functional theme toggle using local storage.
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in the browser's LocalStorage.
- **Insights Engine:** Analyzes total workload and suggests if the day is too heavy.

## 🧮 DOM Concepts Used
- `document.createElement` for dynamic rendering.
- `Event Delegation` for efficient click handling.
- `LocalStorage` API for state management.
- CSS Variables for theme switching.
